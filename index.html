          <p class="bodsuginfo">Just because we have Winter in Canada, it doesn't mean that our bodies needs to be in hibernation mode until the sun starts shining in the Spr ing again. Feel confident and proud no matter the time of year. The natural ingredients of body sugaring not only remove the hair from the root, but do with with much less pain than other hair removal alternatives, such as waxing or shaving. The best part about it is that sugaring products never adhere to live skin cells on bodies, faces, or legs. Therefore, when it is removed, it only gently exfoliates dead skin cells, leaving behind silky smooth skin. How good does that sound?</p>
