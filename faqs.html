		<h2>Eyelash Extenions<h2>
		<h4>Q: What are lash extensions?</h4>
		<p>A: Lash extensions are synthetic lashes that are applied individually to each adult natural lash using an adhesive. There are a wide variety of lashes that can be used in combinations to achieve a look that is individual to each client depending on their needs.</p>
		<h4>Q: Why use Xtreme Lashes?</h4>
		<p>A: All of our products are hypoallergenic and our lashes are among the most natural looking in the industry. Our lashes are light weight so they won't damage you natural lash. We offer a high quality line of lash extension compatible makeup and after care products.</p>
		<h4>Q: Will extensions damage my natural lashes?</h4>
		<p>A: As long as your extensions are applied correctly and done by a certified lash professional, they are not damaging to the natural lashes. Lash stylists are trained to apply the lashes in a way that doesn't put too much stress on your natural lash.</p>
		<h4>Q: Will they look too dramatic?</h4>
		<p>A: With the variety of lashes that Xtreme Lashes offer, the look that you get is tailored to what you want. They are designed to mimic your natural lash so you can go as natural as you wish. A bold look can be achieved as long as your natural lash is strong enough to support the thicker lash extension.</p>
		<h4>Q: How often do I need a fill?</h4>
		<p>A: Eyelash extensions are semi permanent and need to be filled every 2 to 4 weeks depending on the client's after care and how often the natural lash sheds.</p>
		<h4>Q: Can I wear mascara and eyeliner with my extensions?</h4>
		<p>A: Yes. Only water based mascara and eyeliner is allowed though. Oil based products are not allowed to touch your lashes as the oil will dissolve the adhesive causing your extensions to fall off. NO WATERPROOF MASCARA, LINER OR LIQUID LINER.</p>
		<h4>Q: How do I care for my extensions?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>No direct contact with water for at least 24 hours. This allows the adhesive ample drying time.</li>
			<li>Wash them with an oil free cleanser at least once per day. Dirt and oil from the environment that may come in contact with them will shorten their life.</li>
			<li>No oil based products (face wash, eye makeup remover, eye creams, makeup).</li>
			<li>Do not touch or pick at them. Your fingers may have dirt and oil on them.</li>
			<li>A protective lash coating is recommended. It gives them extra protection by providing an invisible protective barrier.</li>
			<li>Do not curl, perm or tint your lashes.</li>
			<li>Try to sleep on your side. Pressing your face into the pillow puts extra strain on the lash extensions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Body Sugaring</h2>
		<p>Q: What is body sugaring?</p>
		<p>A: Body sugaring is a centuries old hair removal practice dating back to the Ancient Egyptians. By applying an all-natural sugar paste to the desired treatment area, the hair is removed from the root in the natural direction of the hair, taking away hair, dead skin and congestion from every hair follicle, without the irritation. This gentle technique significantly reduces the amount of pain normally associated with hair removal. </p>
		<p>Q: How long does my hair have to be before I can get sugared?</p>
		<p>A: Hair can be removed as short as 1/4". Usually about 10-14 days after your last shave.</p>
		<p>Q: Will my hair grow in darker and thicker?</p>
		<p>A: No, it will actually grow in finer and more sparse with time. Over time, frequent sugaring can cause the hair follicle to become damaged, and stop growing hair.</p>
		<p>Q: How often do I need to get sugared?</p>
		<p>A: That depends on the area that is being sugared. For areas such as eyebrows or underarms, once a month should suffice. Full arms can be sugared less than that, and anything below the waist should be done about every 4 weeks.</p>
		<p>Q: Can I be sugared if I have sensitive skin?</p>
		<p>A: Yes! With sugaring, only the dead skin and hair is removed- NONE of your live skin can be removed. It is safe to use on all skin types and conditions such as varicose veins, psoriasis and eczema-prone skin.
